Processing Touch
----------------

What Processing Touch is NOT

It is not a processignjs like port of Processing. Processing Touch is not
able to execute original processing's java style code. You must write in
Cocoa.

Specification mismatch
----------------------

1. When using the QUARTZ2D (P2D) mode, the |arc| method will draw a line
   frome the center of the circle to the end point of the arc.
2. PFont type is not used. Use UIFont instead. Hence the loadFont method is
   not supported.
3. Text mode SHAPE is not supported.
4. You can't use tint(255, alpha) to make a image transparency.
5. Following methods are not supported:
    background(gray)
    background(PImage)
    fill(gray)
    stroke(gray)
    tint(gray)
    background(hex, alpha)
