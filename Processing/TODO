[ ] All
    [ ] Performance
    [ ] Rubustness

[ ] Structure
    [ ] Rename PGraphics protocol, PGraphics2D, PGraphics3D to PRenderxxx.

[ ] PGraphics2D
    [ ] Do not using the ellipse code of Quartz2D? Drawing arc like 
        PGraphics3D?
    [ ] Remove the line from {0, 0} to the end of curve.
    [ ] Lazy initializing matrix stack.
    [ ] Correct tint effect.

[ ] PGraphics3D
    [ ] Better circle drawing.
    [ ] Refine sphere drawing.
    [ ] tint effect when drawing image.
    [ ] Implement Camera.
    [ ] Correct lighting.
    
[ ] Text
    [ ] Draw text in rectangle. Maybe we don't need a layout manager. Just
        use the NSString#drawInRect.
        
[ ] Color
    [ ] Try to support background(float gray) and like. Figure out a way
        to distinguish (valid) gary value and RGBA color value.
    [ ] Don't use PColor. Passing color to renders, since OpenGL can accept
        unsigned byte color.

[ ] Math
    [ ] Perlin Noise performance!
    [ ] Fast inverse square root?
    [ ] Fast sine/cosine, or a LUT should be used.
    
[ ] Processing core
    [ ] File input.
    [ ] Screen aspection support?
    
[ ] Processing functions
    [ ] BLUR filter.
    [ ] ERODE filter.
    [ ] DILATE filter.
    [ ] SOFT_LIGHT blend mode.
    [ ] DODGE blend mode.
    [ ] BURN blend mode.
    [ ] Optimize bilinear interpolation.
    [ ] Use nearest neighbour if smooth is off?
